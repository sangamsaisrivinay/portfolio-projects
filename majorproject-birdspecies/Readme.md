# about project
#### The project focuses on bird species identification using audio signal processing and AlexNet neural network. The tech stack includes Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and modules like NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Keras, and TensorFlow. Data cleaning and audio processing techniques are applied, followed by data visualization and training of a TensorFlow-based neural network. The project aims to classify bird species accurately using audio recordings.
